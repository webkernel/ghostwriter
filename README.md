# Ghostwriter

Enhanced port of the Ghost "[ghostwriter](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter)" theme to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generator, personalised from Juraj Bubniak's [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter) theme.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter.git
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Development

After installing the theme you need to install javascript dependencies. You can use `npm` or `yarn` to install them from `package.json`. `webpack` is used to build and package the styles. In order to develop with realtime reloading of the style in the browser, the powerful commands can be used together.

```bash
hugo server
yarn run watch
```

To update theme styles edit the `styles/style.scss` file. You can then either use the `watch` command of `yarn` or `npm` or run `build` to compile the styles:

```bash
yarn run build
```

## Key Enhancements Introduced

- Support for Table of Contents (TOC) for pages and posts
	- To use, just add `toc : true` to the post/page frontmatter
	- All the headers will be made available as hovering TOC
- Support for link-posts. Just add the URL to be linked to via the title of the post in `refs` parameter in frontmatter.
- Enabled for IndieWeb
	- Validate the compliance with tools at [IndieWebify.me](http://indiewebify.me/)
	- If WebMention endpoint (`webmentionEndpoint`) is configured in `Site.Params` section of `config.toml`, any mentions about the post across web should be pulled at the bottom of the page
	- If MicroPub endpoint (``micropubEndpoint) is configured in `Site.Params` section of `config.toml`, new posts can be added to the site using [MicroPub clients](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients)
- Option to credit the source of the image included in the post. Just add `imgsrc` parameter pointing to the original source in the frontmatter
- Minor improvements in styling across the board
